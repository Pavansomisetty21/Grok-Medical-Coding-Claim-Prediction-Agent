# **Grok-Medical-Coding-Claim-Prediction-Agent**

## **Project Overview**

The **Grok-Medical-Coding-Claim-Prediction-Agent** is an AI-powered assistant designed to help healthcare professionals retrieve **ICD/CPT medical codes** and **predict claim rejection risks** based on the codes provided. By leveraging **LangChain**, **ChatXAI**, and **Grok’s Llama-2 model**, this agent offers an efficient and interactive solution to streamline the **medical coding process** and assist in predicting claim rejections based on specific medical codes.

### Key Features:
- **ICD/CPT Code Lookup:** Retrieve medical codes for diagnoses and procedures.
- **Claim Rejection Prediction:** Analyze medical codes to predict claim rejection risks, improving efficiency and reducing errors.
- **Interactive Chatbot:** Allows users to interact with the agent for real-time responses, using **natural language** queries to fetch results.
- **Memory Buffer:** Tracks the conversation history, ensuring a more personalized and context-aware experience.
- **Customizable Tools:** Includes multiple tools for different functions such as medical code lookup and claim rejection analysis.
  
## **How It Works**

1. **User Input:**  
   The user inputs a query related to medical coding or claim rejection. For example, the query could ask for an ICD or CPT code or inquire about claim rejection risks.

2. **Tool Invocation:**  
   The system uses a combination of **LangChain tools**:
   - **Medical Code Lookup Tool:** This tool fetches relevant **ICD/CPT codes** based on the user query.
   - **Claim Rejection Prediction Tool:** This tool evaluates the medical codes and predicts the likelihood of claim rejection.

3. **Agent Processing:**  
   The system processes the query using **LangChain agents** and **ChatXAI** (powered by **Grok-2-1212** model) for handling the natural language understanding and generating responses.

4. **Memory Integration:**  
   The agent utilizes a **conversation buffer** to store the history of interactions, making the conversation contextually aware and improving the experience for the user.

5. **Real-time Interaction:**  
   The agent runs in an interactive loop, allowing users to input queries and receive responses in real time.

### System Flow:

```plaintext
    [ User Input (Medical Query / Claim Prediction) ]  
        ↓  
    [ Invoke Medical Code Lookup Tool ]  
        ↓  
    [ Invoke Claim Rejection Prediction Tool (Optional) ]  
        ↓  
    [ Agent Processes Query with Memory Integration ]  
        ↓  
    [ Display Result (ICD/CPT Code / Claim Rejection Prediction) ]  
```

## **Technologies Used**

- **LangChain:** A framework to facilitate the development of intelligent agents that interact with different tools.
- **ChatXAI:** AI model used for natural language processing, powered by **Grok-2-1212**.
- **Python:** The programming language used for implementing the agent and its tools.
- **Conversation Buffer Memory:** Ensures the agent can remember previous interactions during the conversation.
- **Grok-2-1212 Model:** AI model used for medical code lookup and claim rejection prediction.


## **Example Usage**

### Sample Interaction:

```plaintext
Medical Coding Agent (Type 'exit' to quit)
You: What is the ICD code for a heart attack?
Agent: The ICD-10 code for heart attack is **I21**.

You: Predict the claim rejection risk for ICD code I21.
Agent: Based on the provided ICD code (I21), the claim rejection risk is **moderate**, as this code is often associated with high medical costs and requires additional documentation for reimbursement.

You: exit
Goodbye!
```

## **Functionality Overview**

### **Medical Code Lookup Tool:**
The agent retrieves medical codes like **ICD** or **CPT** based on a user query. This tool assists healthcare providers and coders in identifying accurate coding for diagnoses and procedures.

### **Claim Rejection Prediction Tool:**
This tool analyzes medical codes and predicts the likelihood of claim rejection based on the conditions or procedures associated with those codes. It helps reduce rejections by flagging potential risks upfront.

### **Agent with Conversation Memory:**
By utilizing **LangChain’s ConversationBufferMemory**, the agent keeps track of the ongoing dialogue, making it easier to handle multi-turn conversations and provide more accurate responses based on the context.

## **Customization and Extensions**

- **Additional Tools:** You can add more tools to the agent, such as additional query types for medical codes or more complex claim rejection predictions.
- **Model Configuration:** You can configure the **ChatXAI** model parameters, such as `temperature`, `max_tokens`, and `max_retries`, to suit your needs.
- **Extend Memory:** Modify the memory settings to store more interactions or provide more advanced tracking of the conversation history.

## **Conclusion**

The **Grok-Medical-Coding-Claim-Prediction-Agent** is a powerful tool for healthcare professionals and medical coders, providing AI-powered insights into medical coding and claim rejection predictions. With integration of **LangChain** and **ChatXAI** (model was **Grok-2-1212**), the system delivers an interactive, real-time experience for querying medical codes and predicting claim rejections, making it easier to streamline medical processes and improve accuracy.
